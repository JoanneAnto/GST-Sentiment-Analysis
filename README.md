# GST-Sentiment-Analysis

GST (Goods and Services Tax) is a comprehensive tax system that was implemented in India in 2017. It replaced a number of indirect taxes at the national level and aims to simplify the tax system and make it more transparent and efficient.

Sentiment analysis refers to the use of natural language processing techniques to identify and extract subjective information from text data. Sentiment analysis can be a useful tool for understanding public opinion and sentiment towards GST, and can provide valuable insights for policymakers and other stakeholders. This is done by collecting and analyzing twitter tweets related to GST.

Most of the opinions were neutral, which means that people were sharing information about the gst instead of sharing any positive or negative opinions.
